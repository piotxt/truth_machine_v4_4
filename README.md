a plug-and-play generative text machine

It uses a corpus of social-media texts posted by Donald J. Trump
between 2015–2017 and 2024–2025.
All code is open source and can be freely used or remixed.

 → Controls:
 SPACE = start/stop | G = generate | Q = quit | I = info

 → Parameters:
 order — how many words the machine remembers; lower = freer, higher = more cohe
 temp  — how unpredictable the language becomes; lower = stable, higher = wild.
